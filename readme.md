Title: Project Disclaimer

Description:
This project was created as part of a Udemy course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS - by Jonas Schmedtmann", and it is not an original work of mine. I undertook this project to learn and follow along with the concepts taught in the course. The course materials served as a valuable guide in the development process, and I'm grateful for the knowledge gained from it.

Acknowledgment:
I want to give credit to the instructor for providing an excellent learning resource and allowing me to gain hands-on experience through this project. If you're interested in the course, you can find it here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wtc/
